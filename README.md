## Deploying to Vercel

To deploy your project to Vercel, especially from a private repository, you need to configure the necessary environment variables.

1.  **Connect your Git repository to Vercel.**
2.  In your Vercel project settings, go to the **Environment Variables** section.
3.  Add the variables listed in the `.env.example` file. Make sure to provide the correct values for your production environment.
4.  Trigger a new deployment.

This will ensure that your project builds successfully.
